Immediates for jcc and call are absolute addresses.
'i' is little endian (least significant byte first in instruction stream).

Encoding of v (for use in conditional move)
also encoding of cc (for use in conditional branch)

0 = always (jmp or movq)
1 = less or equal (jle, cmovle)
2 = less (jl, cmovl)
3 = equal (je, cmove)
4 = not equal (jne, cmovne)
5 = greater or equal (jge, cmovge)
6 = greater (jg, cmovg)

Encoding of z (operation in OPq)
0 = addq
1 = subq
2 = andq
3 = xorq
4 = cmpq

Register name to register number mapping:
rax = 0
rcx = 1
rdx = 2
rbx = 3
rsp = 4
rbp = 5
rsi = 6
rdi = 7
r8  = 8
r9  = 9
r10 = A
r11 = B
r12 = C
r13 = D
r14 = E
r15 = F
